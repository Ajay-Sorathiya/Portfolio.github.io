                <h5>Hello!</h5>
                <h1>Ajay<br>Sorathiya </h1>
                <h4>-Presently, I'm fully dedicated to my academic journey as a student pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Mechatronics Engineering, with a Minor in Internet of Things at G H Patel College of Engineering and Technology. Throughout my academic pursuits, I've diligently honed valuable skills in problem-solving, effective teamwork, and meticulous attention to detail â€“ qualities that I consider pivotal for navigating the rapidly evolving technological landscape.  My sense of responsibility extends beyond the classroom. I actively engage in a range of both technical and non-technical activities. My involvement spans multiple projects and various technical competitions. I've also taken part in impactful social initiatives, including organizing Blood Donation camps, Thalassemia awareness campaigns, and the Clean City Green City campaign through the NSS Cell at the college.  My journey has also taken me into the corporate world, where I've gained diverse experiences through roles as a student intern, intern-trainee, and project intern. This exposure has acquainted me with the dynamic environments of both production and design-oriented projects. In parallel, I've been broadening my horizons by delving into mechanism design and automated manufacturing, aligning with the principles of Industry 4.0.  My aspirations lie in the realms of design, manufacturing, and system operation. I'm eagerly anticipating opportunities that will allow me to further develop my expertise in these areas, fostering innovation and meeting the sector's demands with my skill set.  Participation in various competitions has been a highlight of my academic journey. I've proudly taken part in events such as Robofest-Gujarat 3.0, securing substantial grants totaling 2.5 lakhs. My achievements also include securing the 1st Runner Up position in the state-level IEEE Robomania Competition. Furthermore, my journey took me to the prestigious ABU Robocon competition, marking the commencement of a fulfilling path. Alongside competitions, I've been dedicated to projects like the IoT-Based Ripe or Unripe Fruits/Vegetables Detection and Mechanical Sorting, as well as the SSIP Funded Project: Parishudhdhi Yantra.  In essence, my journey embodies a commitment to academic excellence, hands-on experiences, and a passion for making meaningful contributions to the world of technology.</h4>
